# N_Queens
A C program to generate 1 solution to the 'N-Queens' problem 
This code uses 'Backtracking' via recursion to generate a possible solution.If all the solutions are required, then we need to  remove the 'done' 
part from Play_N_Queens function which stops the function after a single solution is gained.
